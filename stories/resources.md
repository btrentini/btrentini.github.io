Sometimes you just need a push to get started. Here's what worked for me.
Src: https://tinyurl.com/y7bgtyjoData Science happens as a natural consequence of multiple skills and experiences acquired by working with computers, maths, people... Some will develop these skills naturally from multiple experiences along the years. My journey towards data science started 14 years ago (I am updating this post in November 2022), so I've decided to compile the top 7 resources that I reckon to be the first steps that ignited my interest and understanding of this field. The resources below are to engender both the interest and the intuition required for dealing with the data and the science involved. Not a definite guide as there are multiple ways you can become a data scientist, but here's what worked for me.

The key word in "Data Science" is not Data, it is Science - Jeff Leek
Jeff Leek, Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, wrote 5 years ago: "the key word in data science is not 'data'; it is 'science'. Data science is only useful when the data are used to answer a question. That is the science part of the equation. The problem with this view of data science is that it is much harder than the view that focuses on data size or tools. It is much, much easier to calculate the size of a data set and say, 'My data are bigger than yours' or to say, 'I can code in Hadoop, can you?' than to say, 'I have this really hard question, can I answer it with my data?'."
Data Science is old. John Graunt did it when it was cool. Literally cool. It was during the Little Ice Age in the XV century that he developed one of the first works in demography using probabilistic models. By 1960 the subject was already very mature and called datalogy, but it was only in 2012 when Harvard Business Review published the article "Data Scientist: the Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" that the term - and the job - increased in popularity. A great offer of online courses on the subject would be available only two years after this. Google Trends shows something interesting: although the term "Statistician" was trending downwards since 2004, the term "Data Scientist" had a stronger positive movement after HBR's article and it was boosted when the offer of online courses increased.
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=Data%20Scientist,%2Fm%2F0c_xlWith that in mind, I need to make it clear: data scientists are not statisticians, and they don't replace statisticians (and vice-versa), but a genuine interest in statistics and maths are key for proper data science.

In a nutshell the 7 resources are:
The Drunkard's Walk, book by Leonard Mlodinow
Machine Learning Course, Created by Stanford University and taught by Dr. Andrew Ng
Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, also by Stanford and taught by Dr. Keith Devlin
Coding
A prejudice-free review on Maths
People
Having a topic of interest

The list is neither in chronological nor climactic order. A lot of these things will happen in parallel, and items 4 to 7 will almost certainly be part of your routine as a Data Scientist forever!
Let's jump into details…
The Drunkard's Walk
Many years ago (2009?) I wasn't really impressed when I've got this book as a Secret Santa present, but it turned out to be one of my all-time favorites.
The Drunkard's Walk is about understanding randomness' influence in our lives and "reveals the psychological illusions that prevent us understanding everything from stock-picking to wine-tasting", according to Amazon's product description.
It has enlightened me to realize how easily one can become a victim of chance and to understand why explaining all factors leading to an occurrence is much simpler than predicting when - or if - similar occurrences will ever happen again.
From the analytics perspective, this book shows the importance of predictive models and demonstrates the history behind statistical analysis, also showing how data can be used to answer hard questions and how some of these questions will remain unanswered. I recall this as my first contact with "data science".
Another good read in the same style: Algorithms to Live by: The Computer Science of Human Decisions.

Offered by Stanford University on Coursera, this is the entry door for many in Machine Learning. It was mine. This course is interesting, concise, and provides good theoretical foundation.
It first gives you a revision on key concepts of linear algebra and teaches you basic Matlab (or Octave) programming. The very first concepts of Regression with one variable will be presented. Further on the course will walk you through intriguing parts such as Principal Component Analysis and Neural Networks, but if you are serious about learning it with proper reviews, taking quizzes and grasping concepts beyond the course, this will definitely foster your intuition and teach you key artefacts and the maths used in machine learning. This course will help you build strong foundations and prepare you for more advanced concepts.

I took discrete maths at uni back in 2008 and I loved it! It teaches you to think mathematically and logically and express statements mathematically. I did super well in this course during uni… Even still, I decided to review core concepts and boost skills using this course provided by Stanford University via Coursera. The course covers part of what I saw in the first term back then and it bolstered my analytical thinking capabilities. It can easily become a new paradigm to a lot of people as the mathematical thinking proposed in the course differs a lot from the ordinary reasoning process, especially that of common written language. Besides, the last few sessions can become rather challenging on the mathematical-proofing-side-of-things. Unavoidably it will make you feel like learning a new spoken language.
You won't mind learning this "new language" because critical thinking is crucial for data science. An important add-on (or painless alternative) to this course is grasping concepts of common fallacies, to avoid - or detect - them during exploratory data analysis or getting insights from data for example. Here's a list of fallacies.
In summary, I believe that a good data scientist will have an interest in "Mathematical Thinking" to understand how to communicate mathematical concepts and express thoughts as equations, when necessary, or to express mathematical equations into flawless executable steps. On many occasions I faced, knowing how to build a logical argument was more important than being right about methods and the maths. Indeed, the best data scientist I have worked with know how to build arguments and dominate the art of eloquence.

First of all, you should learn how to code regardless of your career choice. It's useful across many areas and can make your life a lot more convenient and fun!
It's true that we may no longer need any coding at all for simpler Data Science routines on forecasting or clustering due to platforms such as Alteryx, Azure Studio, Dataiku, H2O.ai, or Knime who drastically cut the coding effort. However, expertise in coding and common frameworks will still be (and for a long time) an essential asset for dwelling in the realms of confidence, productivity and precision that leads to maintainable workflows, particularly when dealing with absurd amounts of data or real-time applications of Machine Learning or developing new models.
In the beginning your typical questions will be "How do I read this csv into a Data Frame? How do I make simple visualizations? How do I convert all categorical values into numerical? How do I deal with this multi-index dataset?" then at some point you'll progress to things like "will this choice of batch size with this optimizer's learning rate lead to a good loss?" or even things like "Does it make sense to use KL-Divergence for evaluating this model?" or "should I use a Normal-Normal-Inverse-Gamma conjugate in this scenario?"
A simple command with Seaborn can help you build nice visualisations (own source)Fortunately, you have tons of options for dealing with these questions and challenges: more experienced people and reliable online forums (such as Pytorch's Community Forum, it's brilliant).
As per the programming languages, I recommend Python to get started as it is easy to learn, popular among data scientists and has a plethora of libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to deal with data preparation, wrangling and visualisation and frameworks like Tensorflow which, among many perks, allows you to take advantage of GPU processing without hassle.
I am reviewing this blog in 2022 and I also believe that JAX is a great framework to learn.
Another common path is through R (programming language). Yes, it may take longer for you to jump into "data science" with Python whereas R will lead you to Statistical Modelling without ado. Python, on the other hand, will give you a better general understanding of programming principles commonly used beyond data science and in other programming languages such as C++ or Java. Whichever you choose, you'll be fine.
EDIT: It is 2020. I am now becoming a fan of Julia ( https://julialang.org/)
EDIT: It is 2022. I am no longer using Julia (!)
Another great resource is An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by Gareth James. The book is publicly available in the link and covers statistical concepts with R programming. It will be challenging if Linear Algebra scares you (you'll face it right on Page 10). Regardless of the choice you make, you'll need…
…A prejudice-free review on Maths
I did very well at university with a lot of hard work, but it was only in 2013 - more or less when I decided to pursue a Master's degree at some point in the future - that I've recognised how many fundamental concepts were rusty and feeble. Because I was serious about getting into masters, I decided to study assuming I knew nothing about maths so that I could get back to the basics without feeling bad about it. Funny part: I started by watching videos of subtraction and addition for kids.
A few weeks later I moved to the corner stones of data science and machine learning: advanced linear algebra, calculus and probability theory. Although it's not ultimately required for all types of data scientists (only for the good ones!), it's extremely useful to understand, for example, what a Principal Component Analysis is actually doing. Understanding the maths behind data science can help you a lot in your story-telling process, at the very minimum.

EDIT: It is 2022 and I highly recommend studying maths all the time. I am adventuring myself into more complex topics in Bayesian Probabilistic Modelling in the Life Sciences domain. It's awesome.
People
Data Science may require you to sit down, type what seems to be endless lines of code and do feature-engineering for weeks or months before any insightful output (or until your cross-entropy loss function outputs a number close to zero). One cannot fully enjoy the beauty of it without being able to explain at least what is being done at a high-level understanding and why it's done that way. Most importantly, you'll first need a clear definition of the problem you're trying to resolve and if you don't talk to people, you're probably making the wrong assumptions.
Interacting well with people will be one of the greatest boosts for you career as a Data Scientist. Over the past many years, different people helped me discover smarter ways to do my job, make career decisions, navigate political challenges in large companies… A data scientist working alone is probably missing out what's best in this career.
Suppose you're a data scientist working in an e-commerce company who briefed you about the "sudden increase in fraudulent credit card transactions". You still have no clue about the problem, although you may already know some approaches to take. A rookie mistake would be jumping straight into a classification or clustering model just because the word "fraudulent" has induced you in doing so… Exploratory data analysis could help you in the beginning, but key questions remain unanswered: what to analyse, where to start from, what's the end goal and how to measure the impact of your work. You can end up figuring out that the original issue was actually a bug in the latest website release, something that you wouldn't need fancy data science works to figure out.
Evidently, the more experienced one is in a specific domain, the easier it gets to prepare, model and visualize the problem through supporting data and propose solutions to gain productivity or efficiency. Unavoidably, even the most senior data scientists will have to talk to people in every new challenge they face.
Grasping ideas from more experienced people (either in technology or in the business domain) is really useful and a big shortcut in a lot of cases. You can also meet people from all corners to share experiences, attend hackathons and meetups as most major cities around the world will have events of this sort. The key idea is to communicate, learn and share and there's absolutely no excuse for being isolated.
A topic of interest
Edit 2022: The very first topic of interest I discovered in combination with my career as a data scientist was "Heterodox and Orthodox Economics". It was philosophical and mathematical, and I really loved it. Nowadays I am mostly interested in the Life Sciences (Genomics, Proteomics and Biosciences) and foundational mathematical methods. A topic of interest can change over time, but I realized that the interest in a given topic is crucial for a data scientist. The more interest you have in a topic, the easier it gets to be a good data scientist. Sounds obvious, but I spent a few months working as a data scientist in a topic I hated… I did my job well but it was at a high cost as I had no interest in reading about that topic outside work. On the other hand, I have been breathing, eating and watching Biological Data and Probablistic Graphical Models during my free time… In my current job this is making a big difference.
When I started my career, a strong interest in Economics 'catapulted' myself into my first job because I knew what I was talking about and I knew how to conduct analysis and build models to explain what I understood. Over the years, my interest area transitioned to Biology and today I have to express myself and build models with respect to Biological Systems rather than Economic Systems. If you want to get started, picking a topic of interest as a starting point will make a huge difference.
Edit: It is 2020 and since after writing this blog post in 2018 I have adventured myself in other domains such as NLP, Computer Vision and even Reinforcement Learning.

Choosing somewhere to begin from can be daunting and today we have a plethora of options and countless posts like this one. When I originally wrote this post in 2018, Data Science was already hot but not as hot as in 2022. Back in 2009, when I started in this journey, it was difficult to make decisions and get advice so I hope experiences can help you find some resources to get started.
If you want to become a great data scientist my 'recipe' would be this:
Pick a topic of interest (chemistry, economics, biology, games, sports…) and think a lot about it. Read about it. Watch about it. Dream about it.
Connect with people who share your topic of interest via LinkedIn, Meet-ups… ask your friends if they know someone in this space. Connect with professors, researchers. Ask them questions from "how to get started in this field" to how to approach a problem as a data scientist.
Get familiar with the models, maths and methods used to resolve problems in your topic of interest. What are the problems these models try to resolve: are the problems in the data quality, is it predicting future things, or is it classifying things? What are the limitations of the existing models?

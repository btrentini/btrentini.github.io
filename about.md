## About me
Hi, I am **Bruno Trentini**, Developer Relations Manager at NVIDIA. 

I work in the Healthcare Department where I help European Startups build and deploy machine learning models at scale with our models and SDKs (like [BioNeMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNL1z7hnj4w)) and, of course, Hardware (Enterprise-grade [GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/)). I have been focusing on Techbio & Life Sciences and my work is all about getting developers onboarded with our technologies through 1:1 meetings, conferences... The best part of my job is that I get to have daily conversations about the latest in protein design, small molecules, transformer-based models, Geometric Deep Learning, Docking methods... Everything is done alongside awesome colleagues, startup founders, CTOs and researchers. Look at the line up of this [Developer Conference](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/events/healthcare-dev-ai-summit/) I have organized in 2022.

### Education
I did my MSc in Data Science & Machine Learning in the Computer Science Department at [University College London](www.ucl.ac.uk). I've finished it in 2020 with a *Distinction Award* and I had the opportunity to learn from top researchers at DeepMind, META and UCL about Reinforcement Learning, NLP, Graphical Models, Deep Learning... My thesis, supervised by [Prof. Simon Julier](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=BHUj3DkAAAAJ&hl=en) and in partnership with [KIT-AR](https://kit-ar.com/), proposed new techniques for activity classification based on signal motifs. It was through these experiences that I've decided to specialise in Geometric Deep Learning, Dynamic Graphs and Life Sciences (I saw way too many references about motifs in genomics!)

### Work 
Prior to my MSc. I worked 11 years in the industry. Before NVIDIA, I was a Senior Data Scientist at GSK, where I worked on a range of ML and Data Science topics such as recommender systems, optimal resource allocation, Bayesian inference... before that I had mixed experiences in Data Science, Product Management and Software Development across several companies.

My professional timeline goes like this  
> [Biosystems](https://www.biosystems.com.br/) (2006-2007) -> [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.co.uk/) (2008-2010) -> [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_gl) (2011-2012) -> [GVT](https://www.telefonica.com/en/communication-room/telefonica-closes-the-acquisition-of-gvt-and-becomes-the-leading-brazilian-integrated-operator/)(2012-2014) -> [Alliants](www.alliants.com) (2014-2017) -> [HotelBeds](https://www.hotelbeds.com/home) (2017-2018) -> [NVIDIA](www.nvidia.com) (2018-2019) -> MSc @ UCL (2019-2020)-> [GSK](www.gsk.com) (2020-2022) -> [NVIDIA](www.nvidia.com) (2022-Present)

Yes, I am a _boomeranger_ and returned to NVIDIA, the company I left for my MSc

### Conversation starters
You'll often see me with a cup of coffee, a smile and a willingness to chat about machine learning for hours. I am also interested in music (I play the piano and guitar), maths and theology. I am not so great with sports, although I am a fairly decent football player... but I prefer going for long hikes and table tennis.
